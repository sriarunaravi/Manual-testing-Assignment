Black Box Testing	                                                            White Box Testing
No knowledge of internal code	                                             Need Full knowledge of code
It focus on Functionality	                                                 It focus on Internal logic & structure
Performed by Testers	                                                     It Performed mostly by developers
Equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis	                         Statement, branch, path coverage
System, Integration, Acceptance	                                           Unit testing
Example	Checking login with valid/invalid credentials	                     Testing loops, conditions, code paths

Conclusion:
Black box tests what the system does
White box tests how the system works
