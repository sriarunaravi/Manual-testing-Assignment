	    Smoke Testing	                                                             Sanity Testing
To verify that the critical functionalities work	          To verify that specific bug fixes or changes work
Broad and shallow	                                          Narrow and deep
After a new build is received	                              After minor changes or bug fixes
Checks whether the build is stable for further testing	      Checks whether the build is enough to proceed
Usually not documented	                                      Usually not documented
Example	App launches, login works, basic navigation	          Verify fixed payment bug works correctly


Conclusion:
Smoke testing checks "Is the build testable"
Sanity testing checks "Does the specific fix work"
